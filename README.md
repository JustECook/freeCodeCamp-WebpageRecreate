# freeCodeCamp-WebpageRecreate
A recreation of the popular webpage freeCodeCamp.org.

Purpose for Build: 

This project was done to refresh skills in HTML and CSS. It was a challenge getting to simply look at a webpage and attempt to recreate it without viewing the source code. 

About the project:

There is an 'imgage' file which contains the various logos I used. 

Future upgrades: 

This page only shows the top 1/3 of the original website. The goal will be to add a few more features to make it even more like the original. This includes mock testimonials and a preview of the course curriculum
