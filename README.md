# freeCodeCamp-WebpageRecreate
A recreation of the popular webpage freeCodeCamp.org.

Purpose for Build: 

This project was done to refresh skills in HTML and CSS. It was a challenge getting to simply look at a webpage and attempt to recreate the look without viewing the source code. The exercise forced me to think more about how I place items within divs and which classes I select for them. 

About the project files:

There is (1) html document with internal CSS. 

There is an 'image' folder which contains the various logos I used. They're all PNG files so that the backgrounds could easily be removed. 

Future upgrades/modification: 

1. This page only shows the top 1/3 of the original website. The goal will be to add a few more features to make it even more like the original. This includes mock testimonials and a preview of the course curriculum.
2. Remove the internal CSS and link to an external file. This would help with code maintenance by significantly reducing the amount of scrolling in the editor.

I welcome any feedback :)
